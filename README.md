# Android Multiplexing Exploit PoCs

Accompanying PoCs for the paper titled "Abusing Sensor Multiplexing for Covert Channels and Application Fingerprinting on Mobile Devices".

Tested on the Google Pixel 4A (Qualcomm SDM730 SnapDragon 730G; Android 11, build RQ2A.210405.005). The PoCs can be modified to support other evaluated devices (e.g. Xiaomi Pocofone) using the sampling frequencies disclosed in the paper's appendices.

Untested devices may also be vulnerable, but appropriate frequency rates will need defining.
